In this section, we try to use a recently proposed technique called [mixup](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09412). The main idea is to augment the training set with linear combinations of images and labels. Read through the paper and modify your model to implement mixup. Report your performance, along with training/test curves, and comparison with baseline in the report."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"rdBqIs-yJOSc","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1646103267851,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":13639,"user":{"displayName":"Punit
