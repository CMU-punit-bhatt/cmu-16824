This is expected as PASCAL is much more complex than FASHION MNIST, and we need a much beefier model to handle it.\n","\n","In this task we will be constructing a variant of the [AlexNet](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf) architecture, known as CaffeNet. If you are familiar with Caffe, a prototxt of the network is available [here](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/models/bvlc_reference_caffenet/train_val.prototxt).
